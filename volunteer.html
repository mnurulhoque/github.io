								<h3>Covid Relief Activities</h3>
								<article>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/vol3.png" alt="" /></span>In the wake of the persistent challenges brought on by the ongoing COVID-19 second wave, many families, particularly those without access to white cards for monthly rations, have found themselves in increasingly dire straits. We, as part of Dreams Alive Foundation, embarked on a mission to assist those most affected. We identified approximately 50 vulnerable households facing severe hardship due to job losses and diminished incomes. We procured essential groceries to assemble comprehensive food kits designed to sustain these families for an entire month. From pantry staples to essential toiletries, each kit was thoughtfully curated to address their most pressing needs.</p>

								<article>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/vol4.png" alt="" /></span>
										As part of our involvement with the Dreams Alive Foundation, we had the privilege of spreading joy to orphanages on December 25th, Christmas Day. Spending the entire day with the children, we brought smiles and laughter by organizing various activities and providing gifts. With one of our team members donning the role of Santa, we distributed presents and ensured that every child felt cherished and loved. Recognizing the orphanages' need for grocery supplies, we also extended our support in this regard, further enhancing the festive spirit of the day. It was a heartwarming experience to see the joy and happiness we could bring to these children, reaffirming our commitment to making a positive impact in their lives.</p>

								<h3 style="text-align: right;">Kerala Floods 2018 - Relief Activities</h3>
								<article>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/vol6.png" alt="" /></span>During the devastating Kerala floods of 2018, I volunteered to aid those affected by the catastrophe. Witnessing the widespread destruction and displacement of families, I joined hands with the community in relief efforts that spanned over a month. From packing essential groceries across multiple locations to distributing them to those in need, the people of Kerala united tirelessly to assist everyone impacted by the disaster. I was deeply involved in these relief activities, offering assistance in any way I could. It was an immensely rewarding experience to be able to contribute to the recovery efforts during such trying times. Furthermore, I was humbled to receive recognition for my efforts from the District Collector of Kozhikode, who honored me with a certificate of appreciation for my contributions to the relief efforts.</p>
